Hello and welcome to my take at the Groupomania Project. This project is built on a React frontend and NodeJs back-end with a MySQL database.

To launch the project you will have to execute the following steps : 

1. Clone this repo on your computer, open it with your IDE
2. Copy the .env file provided in the projetct .zip in the backend directory : P7groupomania/backend
3. Open a first terminal 
4. Type "cd backend" and "npm install --save" in the terminal
5. type "nodemon server" to run the backend
6. Open a second terminal and in this new one we'll prepare the front-end
7. Navigate to P7groupomania/frontend/groupomania by typing "cd frontend" and "cd groupomania"
8. Type "npm install --save" to install React and its depedencies
9. Type "npm start" to launch the project, after a few seconds type "y" to go port 3001.

Have a nice day !

Pierre
